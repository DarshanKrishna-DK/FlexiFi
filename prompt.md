2. Once the user auth is done, show a general dashboard generated by Agentic AI (google adk and gemini) based on the respective user data provided by the Fi MCP. The dashboard must not exceed 100vh. There should be a chatbot container to the right side next to the dashboard. The chatbot container must be expandable or closed like slide. Dashboard must readjust whenever the chatbot slider is used to probably 65: 35 ratio or whichever is best. 
The dashboard must be professional similar to powerBi dashboards. For chatbot just create the frontend for now. 

Now integrate Gemini to the chatbot and the chatbot must have a button connect to fi. The dashboard must section must display "Connect your FI account to get insights". 
Once the user authenticates, the fi mcp data must be given to a agentic ai which will analyse it and handof to visualiser agent which will generate visualisations and generate the dashboard. The chatbot must have the ability to answer user questions based on the Fi MCP data of the logged in user. 

3. Connect the chatbot with Agentic AI (google adk, gemini) which will answer user prompts (text and voice) with respect to the Fi MCP data for the respective user. The chatbot response must be simple, crisp and on point. The response must be text and must have option of voice response of that text as well.
